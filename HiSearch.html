                        <p>
                            Spring is a fashion and beauty marketplace where people can discover and buy products from different brands. Spring carries 1500+ brands and 200k+ products.

                        <p class="color-text">Spring’s business goal</p>
                        <p>
                            The #1 business goal of Spring is to increase user retention. We wanted to drive our users to come back to Spring after their first purchase and make their 2nd, 3rd, … purchase.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Why improve search</h4>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>For Spring</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The #1 business goal of Spring is to increase user retention. Search is the primary mechanism for achieving Spring's business goal. Because, by early 2018, over 110k unique users already use Spring's search each month, so even a modest increase of search-to-cart conversion will drive significant impact on user retention.
                        </p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>For users</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Search is core to an online shopping experience. Especially when there are 200k+ products on Spring, we want to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for and instill the confidence of starting style search on Spring.

                        <h4>Define vision</h4>
                        <p>Search & Discover squad had a one-day offsite with team members and internal stakeholders. During offsite, the entire team used Spring search, understood our current limitations/pain points, researched competitive landscape, and formulated short and medium term goals for the team.</p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>Vision</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            We better defined our vision for the Search & Discovery initiative:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1. Search and browse are different, search is high-intent, browse is low-intent;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. Priorities: high intent search (query search, search bar, and refinements), browse/suggestion
                        </p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>Success Metrics</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The ultimate success metrics is search-to-cart conversion, at the same time, we will watch search-to-PDP conversion and search-to-love conversion as well.

                        <p>
                            High Intent Search is the top priority of our Search & Discover initiative. After our vision was clearly defined. I started the design process for high intent search from understanding search behavior.

                            <strong>User Interview</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked with our user researcher and conducted user interview with 10 Spring users and 9 non-Spring users. We asked questions to understand their shopping preference and tested Spring's search exerience on both desktop and mobile.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the user interview process, I provided initial questions and search tasks. As the user interviews moved on, I started to build some assumptions and revised research questions/tasks based previous interviews and my assumptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After user research was done. I synthesized the interviews in Trello and found out the common themes in desktop and mobile search experience.

                        <p>
                            After engineers improved the search algorithm, we were able to provide very accurate results for users' high intent search. And then I started to figure out 2 UX problems that came up with the improved search functionality:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>
                                 1. Search Bar & Navigation
                             </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though query search is the most natural way for high intent search, but from user interviews, we found out that users usually don't start their search from search bar because they don't trust search in general for online shopping sites. Our engineers improved the search algorithm and Spring was able to return very relevant items based on users’ search queries.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Design Challenge</strong></p>
                        <p>So the design challenge I had was to fix the current usability issue with our search bar and get more users to start their search from search bar, this way users will find out that Spring provides very great query search experience, and in long term, people will get more confidence of doing fashion search in Spring.</p>

                        <p>I looked at some other shopping sites and tried to figure out what do they want to achieve by design their search in certain ways. I got a lot inspiration and collected some competitive solutions in this doc: <a class="color-text" target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Search-Bar-Nav--ANzUZBE9XIjn3k7aRE1gpC0hAQ-oMi1cQskB0nfqsNl8sfTr">Search Bar & Nav Competitive Solutions</a></p>

                            With Spring’s existing style guide, I skipped wireframing.
                            <br> Keeping the goal in mind, I sketched out design solutions in a few different directions. After took marketing and other stakeholders’ opinion into consideration, direction 2 was most promising one. Because it exposes all the product categories we carry at Spring and provides enough space for navigation dropdown and search suggestions.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As more and more users are starting high intent query search and the search results are getting more and more relevant, we saw a higher possibility that we will have no results or a few results to return based on users' queries. In this situation, what should we show to users and how should we communicate with users to decrease their disappointment?
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Use Cases</strong></p>
                        <p>I started to figure out this problem from thinking of why there are no (or only a few) results returned. I found out there could be 3 different use cases:</p>
                        <p>1. User enters an unmeaningful query.</p>
                        <p>2. User enters a meaningful query, but these product don't exist in Spring.</p>
                        <p>3. User enters a meaningful query, and only a few (less than 6) products match the query.</p>
                        <p><strong>User Experience</strong></p>
                        <p>The principle for No-Search-Result design is to first clearly tell user there are not restuls (or few results) and then give relavent recommendations. </p>
                        <p>After I mapped out all possible use cases, I looped in our tech lead to understand our technical constraints/capability and brain-stormed possible solutions.</p>

                            When users are searching for product with high intent, even though they’ve already type search query into the search bar, they still have go through 3 to 5 clicks in the category tree to get to the sub-category they are looking for. During user interviews, we saw that more than half of the users complained about this.

                            We wanted to drop users on the right sub-category and skip all the clicks. But for gender neutral products (like jeans, sneakers, and etc), if users don’t indicate gender in their search queries, we won’t know which path they should follow.

                            I wireframed 3 potentials solutions, and decided to go with Solution 3. Because in Solution 3, it looks more like part of the refine experience, and in Solution 1 and 2 it takes too much primary space which could be used for something more important potential features.

                        <p>
                            Another challenge I had when designing High Intent Search experience was what’s the best hierarchy for all the refinements on search page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I got 2 different inputs when I tried to figure out refinement hierarchy. Based on the data analysis, I saw there are more clicks on Price and Discount than Color and brands. But from user interviews, I found out people usually refine by brands and colors first, and then sizes, lastly price/discount. Because people don't want to limit the options at the beginning, and usually they don't have a clear bar for price.
                        </p>
                        <p>I finally decided to set the hierarchy based on the input from user interviews, because I believed it’s the natural way of refining a fashion search. </p>

                            Spring has My Sizes feature for all registered members, where users can set up sizes in their profiles and only see what’s in stock in their sizes. But users usually don’t notice it.
