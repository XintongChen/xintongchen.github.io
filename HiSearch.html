                                    Spring is a fashion and beauty marketplace where people can discover and buy products from 1500+ brands.

                        <p>
                            The #1 business goal for Spring is to increase user retention. 
                            Search is the primary mechanism for achieving Spring's business goal; by early 2018, over 110k unique users already use Spring's search each month so even a modest increase of search-to-cart conversion will drive significant impact on user retention.
                        </p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>For users</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Search is core to an online shopping experience. Especially when there are 200k+ products on Spring, we want to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for and instill confidence in starting their style search on Spring.                       
                        </p>

                        <h4>Define vision</h4>
                        <p>Search & Discover squad had a one-day offsite with team members and internal stakeholders. At the offsite, the entire team used Spring search, understood current limitations/pain points, researched competitive landscape, and formulated short and medium term goals for the team.</p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>Vision</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            We better defined our vision for the Search & Discovery initiative:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1. Search and browse are different, search is high-intent, browse is low-intent;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. Priorities: high intent search (query search, search bar, and refinements) first, then browse/suggestion. 
                            <p class="color-text">?</p>

                        <p>
                            The ultimate success metrics is search-to-cart conversion but we will watch search-to-PDP conversion and search-to-love conversion as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>* PDP is reffering to product detail page.</p>

                        <p>
                            High Intent Search is the top priority of our Search & Discover initiative. After our vision was clearly defined. I started the design process for high intent search from understanding search behavior.

                            <strong>User Interviews</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked with our user researcher and conducted user interview with 10 Spring users and 9 non-Spring users. We asked questions to understand their shopping preferences and tested Spring's search exerience on both desktop and mobile.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the user interview process, I provided initial questions and search tasks. As the user interviews moved on, I started to build some assumptions and revised research questions/tasks based on previous interviews and my assumptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After user research was done. I synthesized the interviews in Trello and found out the common themes in desktop and mobile search experiences.

                        <p>
                            2. Improve Category refinement.
                            <br> We didn’t have the resources to improve the structure of Spring’s taxonomy tree. So I took the initiative to figure out how I could improve it from UI level and make it easier for users to refine by categories.

                                            After engineers improved the search algorithm, we were able to provide very accurate results for users' high intent search. And I started to figure out 2 UX problems that came up with the improved search functionality:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>1. Search Bar & Navigation</strong>

                                        <p>
                                            Even though query search is the most natural way for high intent search, but we found out from user interviews that users usually don't start their search from search bar because they don't trust search in general for all online shopping sites. Our engineers improved the search algorithm and enabled Spring to return very relevant items based on users’ search queries.

                                        <p>I need to fix the usability issue with Spring's search bar and get more users to start their search from search bar, this way users will find out that Spring provides very great query search experience, and in long term, people will get more confidence of doing fashion search in Spring.</p>

I collected inspiration and competitive solutions in this doc: <a class="color-text" target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Search-Bar-Nav--ANzUZBE9XIjn3k7aRE1gpC0hAQ-oMi1cQskB0nfqsNl8sfTr">Search Bar & Nav Competitive Solutions</a></p>

                                            With Spring’s existing style guide, I skipped wireframing.
                                            <br> Keeping the goal in mind, I sketched out design solutions in a few different directions. Taking marketing and other stakeholders’ opinions into consideration, direction 2 was most promising one. Because it exposes all the product categories we carry at Spring and provides enough space for navigation dropdown and search suggestions.

                                            I dug deeper into direction 2 and wanted to find out how I could make it even better. I got 2 variations and built prototypes for AB Testing to see what's a better hierachy for search bar and navigation, as well as what's a better way to show search suggestions.

                                            As more and more users are starting high intent query search and the search results are getting more and more relevant, we saw a higher possibility that there will be no results or a few results returned based on users' queries. In this situation, what should we show to users and how should we communicate with users to decrease their disappointment?

                                        <p><strong>Use Cases</strong></p>
                                        <p>I started to figure out this problem from thinking of why there are no (or only a few) results returned. I found out there could be 3 different use cases:</p>
                                        <p>1. User enters an unmeaningful query.</p>
                                        <p>2. User enters a meaningful query, but these products don't exist in Spring.</p>
                                        <p>3. User enters a meaningful query, and only a few (less than 6) products match the query.</p>
                                        <p><strong>User Experience</strong></p>
                                        <p>The principle for No-Search-Result design is to first clearly tell user there are not restuls (or few results) and then give relavent recommendations. </p>
                                        <p>To figure out what are the best recommendations, I mapped out all possible recommendation solutions, looped in our tech lead to understand technical constraints/capability, and evaluated each solution to find the best ones.</p>

During user interviews, we saw that more than half of the users complained about this.

                                            We wanted to drop users on the right sub-category and skip all the clicks. But for gender neutral products (like jeans, sneakers, and etc), if users don’t indicate gender in their search queries, we won’t know which path they should follow.

                                            So we need the user’s input here. The challenge I faced was how to collect users’ inputs and make sure users won’t feel it’s intrude or redundant.

                                            Because the category refinement and breadcrumb are always working together, when making changes on categor refinement, I alse need to take breadcrumb into consideration.

                                            I wireframed 3 potentials solutions, and decided to go with Solution 3. Because in Solution 3, it looks more like part of the refine experience, and in Solution 1 and 2 it takes too much primary space which could be used for something more important potential features.

                                        <p><strong>1. Hierachy</strong></p>
                                        <p>
                                            Another challenge I had when designing High Intent Search experience was what’s the best hierarchy for all the refinements on search page.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I got 2 different inputs when I tried to figure out refinement hierarchy. Based on the data analysis, I saw there are more clicks on Price and Discount than Color and brands. But from user interviews, I found out people usually refine by brands and colors first, and then sizes, lastly price/discount. Because people don't want to limit the options at the beginning, and usually they don't have a clear bar for price.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>I finally decided to set the hierarchy based on the input from user interviews, because I believed it’s the natural way of refining a fashion search. </p>

                                            Spring has My Sizes feature for all registered members, where users can set up sizes in their profiles and only see what’s in stock in their sizes. But users usually don’t notice it.

                                        <p><strong>Design Explorations</strong></p>
                                        I tried 2 placements for the controllers: top and bottom.
                                        <div class="row">
                                            <div class="add-margin col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">

                                            </div>
                                            <div class="img-title col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                                                <hr>Option 1: Controllers at the bottom
                                                <br>Option 2: Controllers at the top
                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>I ended up with having controller at the top, because it a more natural way for user to browse and take actions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Final Design</strong></p>
                                        <p>Here's the design for the new size refinement for Spring members who haven't set up My Sizes yet.</p>
                                        <div class="row">
                                            <div class="add-margin col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">

                        <p><strong>Short-term</strong></p>
                        <p>I wanted to see how this new design works from a quantative perspective. Even though we tested each piece either internally or with a small group of users, I still wanted to see if works well with all users and what we can improve to make this search and refine experience even smoothier.</p>
                        <p><strong>Long-term</strong></p>
                        <p>We have browse and recommendation in our roadmap as the next big step. I am very excited to do more research, understand users' browsing behavior, and figure out the design for low intent shoppers.</p>
                        <p>Another big question in my mind is how could we cover the needs of mid-intent shoppers? Do they exist? How does their shopping behavior look like?</p>
