                        <strong class="color-text">For Spring</strong>
                        <br>
                        The #1 business goal for Spring is to increase user retention.
                        Search is the primary mechanism for achieving Spring's business goal; by early 2018, over 110k unique users already use Spring's search each month so even a modest increase of search-to-cart conversion will drive significant impact on user retention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong class="color-text">For users</strong>
                        <br>
                        Search is core to an online shopping experience. Especially when there are 200k+ products on Spring, we want to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for and instill confidence in starting their style search on Spring.

                        1. Search and browse are different; search is high-intent while browse is low-intent.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked with our user researcher and conducted user interviews with 10 Spring users and 9 non-Spring users. We asked questions to understand their shopping preferences and tested Spring's search exerience on both desktop and mobile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the user interview process, I provided initial questions and search tasks. As the user interviews moved on, I started to build some assumptions and revised research questions/tasks based on previous interviews and my assumptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After interviews were done, I synthesized the interviews in Trello and found out the common themes for desktop and mobile search experiences.

                        To better understand what products are available for the users to search and how Spring organizes all product categories. I took a close look at Spring's taxonomy tree.

                    <p>Combining the research of taxonomy tree and users' search behaviors, I found out there were a few pitfalls in our taxonomy tree, which made some products less searchable/discoverable.

                    <p>
                        After the problems were clearly defined, we took our engineering resources into consideration to assess what problems we would work on at that time. We saw an opportunity to:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. Gain users' confidence in query search by improving the user experience and increasing the accuracy of search.

                    <p>
                        2. Improve the experience of refining by categories.
                        <br> We didn’t have the resources to improve the structure of Spring’s taxonomy tree, so I took the initiative to figure out how I could improve it from the UI level and make it easier for users to refine by categories.

                        To better showcase how I landed on the final design solutions, I will dive into 3 sub-problems and talk about my thinking processes:

                                        After engineers improved the search algorithm, we were able to provide very accurate results for users' high intent search. However, 2 UX problems arose with the improved search functionality:
                                    </p>

                                        Even though query search is the most natural way to conduct high intent search, but we found out from user interviews that users usually don't start their search from the search bar because they usually don’t get relevant search results from most online shopping sites.

                                    <p>I looked at some other shopping sites and analyzed what they wanted to achieve by designing their search in certain ways.

                                        I skipped wireframing since Spring already had a style guide in place.
                                        <br> Keeping the goal in mind, I sketched out design solutions in a few different directions. After I took marketing and other stakeholders’ opinions into consideration, direction 2 was the most promising one because it exposes all the product categories we carry at Spring and provides enough space for the navigation dropdown and search suggestions.

                                        As more and more users are starting high intent query search and the search results are getting more and more relevant, we saw a higher possibility that there will be no results or a few results returned based on users' queries. In this situation, what should we show to users and how should we communicate with users to decrease their disappointment?
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>Use Cases</strong></p>
                                    <p>I started to figure out this problem from thinking of why there are no (or only a few) results returned. I found out there could be 3 different use cases:</p>
                                    <p>1. User enters an unmeaningful query.</p>
                                    <p>2. User enters a meaningful query, but these products don't exist in Spring.</p>
                                    <p>3. User enters a meaningful query, and only a few (less than 6) products match the query.</p>
                                    <p><strong>User Experience</strong></p>
                                    <p>The principle for No-Search-Result design is to first clearly tell user there are not restuls (or few results) and then give relavent recommendations. </p>
                                    <p>To figure out what are the best recommendations, I mapped out all possible recommendation solutions, looped in our tech lead to understand technical constraints/capability, and evaluated each solution to find the best ones.</p>

                                    <p>Use Case 2 is the most tricky one. I decided to provide recommendations based on user's query. With tech lead and PM's input, we were every confident that we will be able to return relavent recommendation at Tier 3.</p>

                                        When users are searching for product with high intent, even though they’ve already type search query into the search bar, they still have go through 3 to 5 clicks in the category tree to get to the sub-category they are looking for. During user interviews, we saw that more than half of the users complained about this.

                                        We wanted to drop users on the right sub-category and skip all the clicks. But for gender neutral products (like jeans, sneakers, and etc), if users don’t indicate gender in their search queries, we won’t know which path they should follow.

                                        So we need the user’s input here. The challenge I faced was how to collect users’ inputs and make sure users won’t feel it’s intrude or redundant.

                                        Because the category refinement and breadcrumb are always working together, when making changes on categor refinement, I alse need to take breadcrumb into consideration.

                                        I wireframed 3 potentials solutions, and decided to go with Solution 3. Because in Solution 3, it looks more like part of the refine experience, and in Solution 1 and 2 it takes too much primary space which could be used for something more important potential features.

                                        Within in Solution 3, I tried a few different visual treatments and prototyped 2 of them. We did intercal testing on category refinement and breadcrumb internally with 2 groups people.

                                    <p>
                                        I got 2 different inputs when I tried to figure out refinement hierarchy. Based on the data analysis, I saw there are more clicks on Price and Discount than Color and brands. But from user interviews, I found out people usually refine by brands and colors first, and then sizes, lastly price/discount. Because people don't want to limit the options at the beginning, and usually they don't have a clear bar for price.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I finally decided to set the hierarchy based on the input from user interviews, because I believed it’s the natural way of refining a fashion search. </p>

                                            <hr>Decided the hierarchy of refinements based on the most common use case we found during user interviews:
                                            <br>Categories, Brands, Color, Size, Discount, and Price.
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                    <hr>
                                    <p class="color-text"><strong>(2) Refinements</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Through user interviews, we saw different usability issues with different refinements. I created design solutions, tested them internally, and landed on the following design.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Brands</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We listed all available brands A to Z before, which is very hard for users to browse and find out the brands that they are looking for. In the new design, we wanted to predit the brands people may click and list these brands at the top.</p>
                                    <p>Which brands should be listed in the Top Brands group is still an open questions. We will testing among Favoirt Brands, Liked Brands, Popular Brands, and etc to figure which is the best.</p>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <div class="add-margin col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                                            <a href="img/search-brand.png" data-fancybox="picker">
                                                <img src="img/search-brand.png" alt="">
                                            </a>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                    <p><strong>Sizes & My Sizes</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        There were only a few size options before, and Sizes refinement was very apart from My Sizes feature, which meant users have to set up size preference at 2 different places. I improved the Sizes refinement by combining Sizes refinement and My Sizes and providing a better way of browse size options.
                                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Short-term</strong></p>
                    <p>I wanted to see how this new design works from a quantative perspective. Even though we tested each piece either internally or with a small group of users, I still wanted to see if works well with all users and what we can improve to make this search and refine experience even smoothier.</p>
                    <p><strong>Long-term</strong></p>
                    <p>We have browse and recommendation in our roadmap as the next big step. I am very excited to do more research, understand users' browsing behavior, and figure out the design for low intent shoppers.</p>
                    <p>Another big question in my mind is how could we cover the needs of mid-intent shoppers? Do they exist? How does their shopping behavior look like?</p>
