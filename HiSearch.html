                        <p>
                            Spring is a fashion and beauty marketplace where people can discover and buy products from different brands. Spring carries 1500+ brands and 200k+ products.
                        </p>
                        <p class="color-text">Spring’s business goal</p>
                        <p>
                            The #1 business goal of Spring is to increase user retention. We wanted to drive our users to come back to Spring after their first purchase and make their 2nd, 3rd, … purchase.
                        </p>
                    </div> -->

                        <h4>Why improve search</h4>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>For Spring</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The #1 business goal of Spring is to increase user retention. Search is the primary mechanism for achieving Spring's business goal. Because, by early 2018, over 110k unique users already use Spring's search each month, so even a modest increase of search-to-cart conversion will drive significant impact on user retention.
                        </p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>For users</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Search is core to an online shopping experience. Especially when there are 200k+ products on Spring, we want to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for and instill the confidence of starting style search on Spring.

                        <h4>Define vision</h4>
                        <p>Search & Discover squad had a one-day offsite with team members and internal stakeholders. During offsite, the entire team used Spring search, understood our current limitations/pain points, researched competitive landscape, and formulated short and medium term goals for the team.</p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>Vision</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            After offsite, we better defined our vision for the Search & Discovery initiative:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1. Search and browse are different, search is high-intent, browse is low-intent;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. Priorities: high intent search (refinements, search bar, and navigation bar), browse/suggestion
                        </p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>Success Metrics</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The ultimate success metrics is search-to-cart conversion, at the same time, we will watch search-to-PDP conversion and search-to-love conversion as well.
                        </p>
                        <p class="color-text"><strong>High Intent Search</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            After we defined the vision for the Search & Discover initiative, I started the design process for high intent search from understanding search behavior.

                            I worked with our user researcher and spoke to 10 Spring users and 9 non-Spring users. We tested our search exerience on both desktop and mobile.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the user research process, I provided search tasks to make sure we can get the most from observing users’ search experience. As the user interviews moving on, I started to build some assumptions and revised research questions/tasks based previous interviews and my assumptions.

                            During the problem discovery phase, I was also asking myself what does a good search look like, what are the current solutions, and what I can learn from it? To answer all these questions, I did competitive research on other online shopping websites/apps, such as, ASOS, Lyst, ShopStyle, Revolve, and etc…

                            There are multiple entry points for Search. Before I officially started any design, I mapped out all the possible search flows, so that I can take all possible scenarios into consideration.
