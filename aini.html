            <p>
                We had a surprise party for a to-be-dad on Core team. He said he was so happy and nervous, and cut the cake carefully with a peaceful smile. He took so many photos with the decorations and the cake. I think he will definitely share these with his wife after work. I looked at him and started to think about one day you will have a to-be-dad party at your office as well.
                And then I started to picture how you will share this experience with me when you are back home. When I noticed I have tears in my eyes, I tried hard to hold them and didn’t want my colleagues to see me crying.

                I know we’ve gone through lots of difficult times recently. And because of these difficulties, I got very emotional and sensitive, but at the same time I believe after we get through this bump, our life will be much smoother.
                This is almost the first time we get into a tough situation like this and both of us feel painful. But I am willing to over come all of these challenges with you but not anyone else. I guess we will laugh at these experience when we are old.
            </p>
            <p>
                You say that we have very different personalities, but that’s what I like about our relationship. Because of the different personalities we could expand our life in a way that we never expected before. I never expected I will do so many board games with your friends and cousin. And I guess you never expected our day trip to Art Omi would be so fun and unforgettable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I look forward to creating more memories for us ❤️
