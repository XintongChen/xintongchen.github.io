                I had lunch with a designer today and she said she will go to Germany next week for her best friend’s wedding. She said the groom is from Germany and the Bride is from California. They had long distance during their twenties and flew to see each other every few months. A few years ago the Bride moved to Germany and started to learn German, and now she’s having a life there. My designer colleague said “these are the crazy things people do for love”. This was another time I have to hold back my tears at work.

                I felt so lucky that I asked this designer for lunch and heard this story. I am taking every minute now to write down my thinkings and feelings.

                I believed that moving to China for one year or two could be a positive adventure for us while we are young. Even though there were concerns, I believed by the end it would be a challenging yet enjoyable experience. That’s why I was trying so hard to make it happen. But I think I wasn’t able to dismiss your concerns well enough and I definitely underestimated the pressure you had in the past 1.5 months.

                After hearing the story, I feel neither of us has done enough for our love. I haven’t done enough “crazy” things for our love yet. I won’t accept that we will get separate without even trying to fix the problems we have. Being with you is more important than having any experience by myself. If you are not by my side, how could I enjoy anything by myself. I am willing to stay, fix everything and make our life better with you. ❤️
